    \section{Week 3 - What is Mathematical
Modeling?}\label{week-3---what-is-mathematical-modeling}

Nature reveals itself to us through interactions. We can tell from
observations that it is nature's interactions that lead to its
evolution. How nature is changing and predicting how it will change in
the future is the work of science. In this work, we observe nature and
its interactions to make models of those observations. We aim to predict
and explain our observations of nature through this building of models.

In physics, our goals are typically to explain and predict observations
of physical phenomenon. Here, we focus ourselves to those canonical
things that physicists concern themselves with: motion, fields, waves,
atoms, nuclei, and so on.

```\{admonition\} Why the word ``observation''? :class: note

We intentionally use the word observations here, because we are not
simply talking about what we can see with our eyes. The visible spectrum
is limited to a small portion of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum}{electromagnetic
spectrum}.

These observations can come in the form of light, but also as sound,
voltage, or current. For example, most instrumentation in laboratories
will report only voltages or currents -- rather voltages and currents
are what the equipment will measure precisely and report as measurements
as different as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_rangefinder}{distance} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheometer}{shear stress response}.

Lastly, we use ``observation'' because it includes the historical
science that conducted qualitative investigations and conceptual
observations. It is also language that includes the work of early
cultures who made observations and constructed ways of knowing and
explaining the world around them. ```

    \subsection{What is a model?}\label{what-is-a-model}

Physics is a science that builds models. Typically, these models are
represented mathematically in the form of equations or formula, but we
can use charts, graphs, animations, and so on to represent our models.
Models used in physics are often constructed by a community of
scientists who have agreed on the model's utility and accuracy.
Experimental observations are used to validate these models.

Modeling is the process of constructing a model. This process is often
iterative where the initial ideas and assumptions are used to formulate
a model. It is then tested against observations and refined. This
process is repeated until the model is accurate enough to be useful.
Physicists are model builders and model users.

Geoscientist \href{https://mnky9800n.github.io/}{John Aiken} made this
short video when he was a graduate student at Georgia Tech. John cut
clips from a lecture
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman}{Richard Feynman}
gave. In this lecture, Feynman talks about the nature of models and the
process of science. John also interviewed different science researchers
and teachers about their understanding of what a model is.

\subsubsection{Feynman on the Process of
Science}\label{feynman-on-the-process-of-science}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman}{Richard Feynman}
was a physicist who made significant contributions to physics,
especially in the field of quantum mechanics. He was awarded the
\href{https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/feynman/}{Nobel
Prize in Physics in 1965} for his work in quantum electrodynamics. In
his time, he was known as a great teacher and communicator of physics.
And \href{https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/}{his lectures} are
still used in physics education today -- even for planning this class.

Feynman was a gifted communicator; his lectures are lively and
conceptual. Here's the longer version of the lecture he gave on the
nature of models and the process of science.

```\{admonition\} Richard Feynman's Legacy :class: warning

While we acknowledge the importance of Feynman's contributions to
physics and physics teaching, we should remind ourselves that he was not
a perfect person. Feynman was also known for his
\href{https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/surely-youre-a-creep-mr-feynman-mcneill}{sexist
behavior and comments}. (\emph{Trigger warning}: this link recounts
instances of harassment)

We should not ignore this aspect of his life, and remind ourselves that
we can learn from his physics and make a welcoming space for all people.
```

    \subsubsection{History and Philosophy of
Science}\label{history-and-philosophy-of-science}

If you would like to dive deeper into models and modeling, there's
excellent work in history and philosophy of science. The field studies
how science develops knowledge, practice, culture, and so on. It studies
important events and provides critical information on important and,
often, overlooked folks who do science. For example, historian and
gender studies professor
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Traweek}{Sharon Traweek}
studies the high energy physics field. Her book,
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamtimes_and_Lifetimes}{Beamtimes
and Lifetimes: The World of High Energy Physicists} is excellent.

```\{admonition\} Dame Nancy Cartwright (philosopher of science) :class:
note

One of the more interesting scholars is
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Cartwright_(philosopher)}{Dame
Nancy Cartwright} who wrote a lot about the `practice of science.' Her
philosophical work informed many of the innovations in physics and
broader science education -- including many science courses at MSU.

Her writing is very interesting, but the style of writing can be a
challenge to read. This is the nature of academic writing in different
disciplines. Her book called ``How The Laws of Physics Lie'' is worth a
read. Here's a link to the
\href{http://www.generativescience.org/papers/nature/Cartwright-_1983.pdf}{first
chapter}. ```
