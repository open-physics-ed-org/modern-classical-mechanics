title: Mobile menu hamburger does not open on click
labels: bug, website, html
---
On mobile devices, the navigation menu correctly collapses to a hamburger icon, but clicking the hamburger does not open or close the menu. This makes navigation inaccessible on mobile.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the site on a mobile device or resize the browser to mobile width.
2. Observe the hamburger icon appears.
3. Tap/click the hamburger icon.
4. Nothing happens; the menu does not open.

Expected: Tapping the hamburger should open and close the menu.

This is a critical accessibility and usability bug for mobile users.
