    \section{Week 6 - Stability and
Equilibria}\label{week-6---stability-and-equilibria}

We have shown that we can develop trajectories of different physical
systems by solving the differential equations that describe them. This
is a useful approach, but it often means we are focused on a single
trajectory. This might be fine if all the trajectories are the same or
roughly so, say like the 1D falling ball, or the simple harmonic
oscillator.

Systems can produce multiple families of trajectories depending on the
parameter choices, and the initial conditions associated with the
problem you are solving. A more general approach that starts us down the
road of characterizing the many potential behaviors that a physical
system can exhibit is to consider
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory}{stability}. As we
will build the toolkit to investigate classical systems, understanding
equilibrium points and their stability is a useful step.

    \subsection{Why do we study stability and
equilibria?}\label{why-do-we-study-stability-and-equilibria}

First, because nature is often moving towards a state of equilibrium
because those states are associated, as we will see, with the lowest
local energy state. It takes energy to move away from stable
equilibrium, and physical systems tend to minimize their energy --
because those configurations are often quite stable.

Much of the physics that we do today focuses on
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics}{non-equilibrium
systems}. These are systems that are typically driven by external
interactions to ensure the system remains out of equilibrium. The
responses of these systems to this driving and how they might relax to
equilibrium are often studied.

Second, we can often start from the equilibrium points of a system and
then perturb the system to see how it responds. We know how to solve
problems around equilibrium points, and working with fully
non-equilibrium systems is often much harder.

We have gotten much better at working in non-equilibrium spaces,
especially as we have developed computing tools that can help us
simulate the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium.

    \subsection{The Simple Harmonic Oscillator Models Many
Systems}\label{the-simple-harmonic-oscillator-models-many-systems}

You have used the simple harmonic oscillator frequently.

There's a reason for that.

It provides the simplest example of a system that exhibits periodic
motion. It also is a system with one of the simplest energy landscapes
-- a parabola; and it has a global stable equilibrium point at the
bottom of the potential well.

There are many systems that we can transform into a simple harmonic
oscillator. And it is not because the world is full of springs and
masses. It is because the simple harmonic oscillator is a good model for
many systems near their local equilibrium points. In fact, as you will
see, it is the leading (non-constant) term in every Taylor expansion of
a 1D potential energy function near a local minimum.

\subsubsection{Another SHO Example - A
Pendulum}\label{another-sho-example---a-pendulum}

Consider a pendulum of mass \(m\) and length \(L\) that is displaced
from the vertical by an angle \(\theta\). We can show that the complete
equation of motion (without drag) is:

\[mL\ddot{\theta} = - mg\sin \theta,\]

\[\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{L}\sin \theta.\]

Typically we limit to small angles, so \(\sin \theta \approx \theta\),
and the equation becomes:

\[\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{L}\theta.\]

This is a second order differential equation that we have solved before.
The general EOM for a simple harmonic oscillator is:

\[\ddot{x} = -\omega^2 x.\]

A general solution to this equation is:

\[x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi),\]

where \(A\) is the amplitude of the oscillation, \(\omega\) is the
angular frequency of the oscillation, and \(\phi\) is the phase of the
oscillation.

This model of an SHO works with many systems, not just pendulums. Here's
some examples along with the equivalent natural oscillation frequency,
\(\omega^2\), for each system:

\end{longtable}

    \subsubsection{Stability of the SHO}\label{stability-of-the-sho}

Regardless of the choice of physical model, the SHO equation is the same
second order differential equation, which we write in general as:

\[\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\omega^2 x\]

For a given system, this results in a potential energy that is
proportional to the square of the variable \(x\) (the ``stretch'') and
to the square of the frequency \(\omega\). This potential energy is
always positive, and it can have a non-zero minimum.

\[U(x) = \frac{1}{2} \xi \omega^2 x^2 + U_0\]

where \(\xi\) is a positive constant (with units!) of proportionality.
In the case of a mass on a spring, \(\xi = m\). We can find the
equilibrium points by setting taking the first derivative of the
potential energy and setting it to zero.

\[\frac{dU}{dx} = \xi \omega^2 x = 0\]

This gives us the equilibrium point at \(x = 0\). We might have expected
this, as the potential energy is a parabola, and the minimum of a
parabola is at the vertex. We can also determine the stability of this
equilibrium point by looking at the second derivative of the potential
energy, and evaluating it at the equilibrium point.

\[\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = \xi \omega^2 > 0\]

This number is always positive, indicating that for an SHO, the
equilibrium point is stable. This is a general result for the SHO, and
it is true for all the systems listed above.

    \subsection{Interpreting your
Analysis}\label{interpreting-your-analysis}

Above, we completed an analysis of the simplest system that we will work
with. It lead us to find a global minimum in the potential energy, so
that suggests a few things for us to think about:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{The SHO is a conservative system - the total energy of the
  system is conserved.} So any trajectory will oscillate between kinetic
  and potential energy, but the total energy will remain constant. This
  is not something that will always be true.
\item
  \textbf{The SHO has a global minimum in potential energy - a globally
  stable equilibrium point.} Oscillations will always occur around this
  point. Global stability is a very strong form of stability; it is also
  rare in that most systems have multiple equilibrium points: some are
  stable, some are not, and some are
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability}{metastable}.
\item
  \textbf{If the SHO starts at rest at the equilibrium point, it will
  remain there.} It will take energy put into the system to move away
  from the equilibrium point. Because this a global minimum, all
  trajectories will oscillate around this point. However, in systems
  with local equilibrium points, the system can be perturbed away from
  the equilibrium point, and end up in a different equilibrium point.
  This is a common feature of many systems.
\item
  \textbf{If there are interactions that remove energy from the system,
  the system will eventually come to rest at the equilibrium point.}
  This is a common feature of many systems.
\end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Where are we going?}\label{where-are-we-going}

This work we are doing to understand equations of motion, stability, and
equilibrium points is foundational. Some of the most exciting physics we
see today is rooted in understanding how systems move away from
equilibrium, and how they respond to external driving.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory}{Chaos theory} is a
field that has grown out of understanding how systems can be very
sensitive to initial conditions, and how they can exhibit complex
behavior.

We will start to use these ideas from this week into next week as we
build a set of additional tools like
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space}{phase space diagrams}
and using asymptotic behavior to investigate and explain the behavior of
physical systems.

To introduce some of those initial ideas here are two videos from
different physics perspectives on the topic of chaos.

\subsubsection{Veritasium - THe Butterfly Effect and Chaotic Systems (13
minute
video)}\label{veritasium---the-butterfly-effect-and-chaotic-systems-13-minute-video}

In this video, Derek Muller uses the typical example of the Butterfly
Effect to introduce the idea of chaos theory. The philosophical aspects
of the butterfly effect are interesting, but not real in any physical
sense. Instead, it's a metaphor for the idea that small changes in
initial conditions can lead to large changes in the system. Muller
contrasts our understanding of determinism with uncertainty; he
introduces the concepts of sensitivity to initial conditions and
discusses the idea of an attractor.

\subsubsection{University of Bristol - Chaos Theory and Randomness (8
minute
video)}\label{university-of-bristol---chaos-theory-and-randomness-8-minute-video}

In this video, two researchers from the University of Bristol
(\href{https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/}{Jens Marklof} and
\href{https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~te20281/}{Henna Koivusalo})
discuss the idea of chaos theory from a more mathematical perspective -
remdining us of the differences between randomness and chaos. The
overlap between physicists and mathematicians in the study of chaos is
significant. One important contribution is
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system}{Dynamical
systems}, which is a mathematical framework that is used to study these
behaviors. The researchers who do this work are mathematicians,
physicists, engineers, and computer scientists. They do experiments, but
they also do a lot of mathematical modeling.
