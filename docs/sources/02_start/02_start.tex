    \section{Week 2 - Computing as a tool for
science}\label{week-2---computing-as-a-tool-for-science}

    One of the first ideas that we developed was a model of a falling ball
in one-dimension. We obtained the following differential equation that
described the motion of the ball:

\[\ddot{y} = g - \dfrac{b}{m}\dot{y} - \dfrac{c}{m}\dot{y}^2.\]

This \emph{nonlinear} second-order differential equation is the
\textbf{equation of motion} for the ball. It is nonlinear because the
term \(\dot{y}^2\) appears in the equation.

\textbf{Can you think of an anti-derivative for this equation?}
\emph{Probably not.}

We can change the equation to a system of first-order differential
equations by defining a new variable \(v = \dot{y}\), so that the
equation becomes:

\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{y} &= v, \\
\dot{v} &= g - \dfrac{b}{m}v - \dfrac{c}{m}v^2.
\end{aligned}\]

But the equation for \(v\) is still nonlinear. Clearly we need a
different approach to solving this problem. In fact, we need a more
generic approach to investigate equations of motion for systems like
this. Most models of physical systems cannot be solved in closed
analytical form. But, this approach to writing \(N\)th order
differential equations as a system of \(N\) first-order differential
equations is a powerful tool in computational physics.

    ```\{admonition\} Limitations of only working with analytically solvable
problems :class: note

The problems that we often present in physics classes lend themselves to
analytical solutions because we (collectively as a physics community)
decided on the kinds of illustrative problems for students to work and
solve. We did this at a time when computing was inaccessible and less
pervasive in society, but also when we knew little about how people
learn.

The choices we made in the past convey a false impression that most
physics problems can be solved analytically. But more importantly, our
choices convey that finding the solution is the goal of physics. This is
not the case. The goal of physics is to understand the world around us.
When we continue to focus exclusively on systems that can be solved
analytically, we continue to perpetuate those impressions.

There's a movement of physics instructors across the world building
these forward-looking pedagogies and curricula. They work loosely
through a collective called the
\href{https://www.compadre.org/PICUP/}{Partnership for Integration of
Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP)}.

In our class, we aim to build a set of investigative tools and
approaches that we can use in Classical Mechanics. ```

    \subsection{Scientific Computing}\label{scientific-computing}

In this course, we will explore a broad class of problems using plotting
and numerical integration as principal tools. These techniques and
algorithms, along with the software we use, fall within the broader
field of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_computing}{scientific
computing}. Scientific computing focuses on developing mathematical
models and numerical methods to solve problems in the natural sciences
and engineering.

For historical context, the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_computing}{Timeline
of the Development of Scientific Computing} provides an excellent
overview. The roots of this field trace back to significant advancements
long before modern electronic devices. Much of the foundational
mathematics, such as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method}{Euler's Method} for
solving differential equations, was developed in the 18th century by
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler}{Leonhard Euler}.
Implementing these algorithms on computers was a natural progression in
scientific problem-solving.

\subsubsection{History of Computing}\label{history-of-computing}

The history of scientific computing is deeply intertwined with the
evolution of computing itself, a fascinating and complex narrative
encompassing technical, social, political, and economic perspectives.
Contributions to computing originated worldwide, starting with tools
like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus}{abacus} in ancient
China. Mechanical innovations such as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal\%27s_calculator}{Pascal's
adding machine} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine}{Babbage's
Analytical Engine} marked significant milestones leading toward the
modern computer.

To get an introductory overview, the video below from Futurology is a
helpful resource, but it is by no means comprehensive or critical.

    \subsection{A Critical Perspective on
Computing}\label{a-critical-perspective-on-computing}

While the history of computing is often celebrated as a story of
innovation, it is deeply entangled with systems of power, exploitation,
and violence. Computing technologies have not only been tools of
scientific progress but also instruments for surveillance, war, and
perpetuation of systemic biases.

```\{admonition\} Humans as Computers :class: note

Of course, the development of electronic computers was a huge
development for science. Prior to that, humans were employed to do the
calculations that we now do with computational algorithms. This work
occurred in a wide variety of labs where data were entered into tables,
calculations were done by hand, and the results were tabulated manually.

Frequently the work was done by those with less power in the laboratory
and broader society (e.g., women, immigrants, and folks of color). A
notable and well-known example is the work of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers}{Harvard
Computers} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries where women were
employed to do the calculations that led to significant discoveries in
astronomy.

\end{figure}

One of the most important examples is the work done by African-American
women at NASA in the 1960s, as depicted in the book and movie
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures}{Hidden Figures}.

The algorithms driving modern computing are not neutral---they reflect
the biases of the societies that create them. In
\href{https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/}{Cathy
O'Neil's \emph{Weapons of Math Destruction}}, the author explores how
algorithms used in areas like policing, hiring, and education often
reinforce systemic inequality, disproportionately harming marginalized
communities. Similarly,
\href{https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology}{Ruha
Benjamin's \emph{Race After Technology}} examines how race and
technology intersect, showing how seemingly ``objective'' systems encode
and perpetuate racial biases.

The use of AI in policing is another area of concern.
\href{https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters}{Simone Browne's
\emph{Dark Matters}} highlights how surveillance technologies, from
facial recognition to predictive policing, are rooted in practices of
racialized social control, extending systems of oppression into the
digital realm.

The militarization of AI is one of the most alarming developments in
computing. AI-driven drones and autonomous weapons, often described as
the future of warfare, raise profound ethical and humanitarian concerns.
\href{https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/}{Shoshana Zuboff's
\emph{The Age of Surveillance Capitalism}} discusses how the same
technologies used for corporate profit are repurposed for state
surveillance and military applications, blurring the lines between
civilian and combatant spaces.

Additionally,
\href{https://peterasaro.org/writing/Asaro\%20Oxford\%20AI\%20Ethics\%20AWS.pdf}{Peter
Asaro's work on lethal autonomous weapons} questions the morality and
legality of machines making life-and-death decisions. Meanwhile,
\href{https://katecrawford.net/atlas}{Kate Crawford's \emph{Atlas of
AI}} explores how AI systems, from mining rare earth materials to
deployment in warfare, are deeply intertwined with colonial exploitation
and ecological destruction.

The tech industry's focus on profit has devastating environmental and
social impacts. Computing relies on the extraction of rare materials,
energy-intensive processes, and exploitative labor practices.
\href{https://thischangeseverything.org/}{Naomi Klein's \emph{This
Changes Everything}} examines how capitalism exacerbates climate change,
with insights into the environmental toll of computing technologies.
\href{https://cup.columbia.edu/book/artificial-whiteness/9780231194914}{Yarden
Katz's \emph{Artificial Whiteness}} connects the development of AI to
broader systems of capitalist and racial oppression.
